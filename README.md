# Revamped Astro Zozo

A warm, editorial Astro 6 blog theme with gallery, friends page, Pagefind search, and light/dark mode — built for writers and creatives who want more than a minimal blog.

Revamped Astro Zozo is a sample-first Astro theme starter built with [Astro](https://astro.build), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [Bun](https://bun.sh/). It builds on the lightweight writing flow of [astro-blog-zozo](https://github.com/ladit/astro-blog-zozo) and adds a warmer visual system, richer content surfaces, and pages that go beyond a simple post list.

## What Changed From Astro Zozo

This template keeps the lightweight writing flow of Astro Zozo, then adds:

- a warmer light and dark palette with a more unified surface system
- a rewritten scaffold layout, footer, and navigation state treatment
- matching hero-style `Home` and `About` layouts
- a `/friends` page for curated link cards
- a `/gallery` route with category walls, viewer pages, notes, and optional focus hotspots
- markdown-backed gallery entries under `src/content/gallery/`
- a more compact mobile menu and tightened page heading system

## Sample Content

This theme intentionally replaces personal material with reusable sample content:

- sample blog posts with theme overview and setup guidance
- sample gallery entries with Unsplash photos and photographer credits
- sample friends data with portrait avatars
- sample branding, hero art, and a geometric logo

Use this theme as a base, then swap the sample content for your own writing, media, and visual identity. Sample photos are from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com).

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `bun install` or `npm install`
3. Run `bun run dev` or `npm run dev`
4. Replace branding in `src/config.ts`, posts in `src/content/posts/`, gallery entries in `src/content/gallery/`, and friends data in `src/data/friends.ts`

Important folders to customize first:

- `src/config.ts` for site title, description, socials, and toggles
- `src/content/posts/` for blog posts
- `src/content/gallery/` for gallery entries and notes
- `src/data/friends.ts` for curated links
- `public/sample/` and `src/assets/sample/` for hero art, avatars, and gallery media

## Project Structure

- `src/content/posts/`: blog posts
- `src/content/gallery/`: gallery entries grouped by category
- `src/assets/sample/gallery/`: sample gallery media
- `src/assets/sample/portraits/`: sample focus portraits for interactive illustration pages
- `public/sample/`: logo, hero art, and friend avatars
- `src/data/friends.ts`: friends page data
- `src/config.ts`: site title, description, social links, and toggles
- `src/pages/`: route files
- `src/components/`: reusable UI parts
- `src/layouts/`: site layouts and page shells
- `src/utils/`: content, gallery, and UI-support helpers
- `docs/screenshots/`: theme preview captures for README and Astro Themes submission
